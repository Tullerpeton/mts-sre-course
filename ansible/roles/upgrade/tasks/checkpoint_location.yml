# This playbook performs several tasks related to PostgreSQL's "Latest checkpoint location":
# 1. Retrieves the value from the cluster leader and its replicas.
# 2. Debugs this value for both leader and replicas.
# 3. Determines if the values match across the leader and replicas, setting 'pg_checkpoint_location_match' accordingly.
# 4. If the values match across all nodes, a success message is displayed and the update procedure continues.
# 5. If there's a mismatch, the previously stopped cluster starts (rollback), and the playbook stops with an error message.
