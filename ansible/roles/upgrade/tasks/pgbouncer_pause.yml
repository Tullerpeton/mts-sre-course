# Perform PAUSE in parallel on all pgbouncers servers
#
# This script performs the following actions:
# 1. Waits for active queries on the database servers to complete (with a runtime more than 'pg_slow_active_query_treshold').
# 2. If there are no active queries, sends a PAUSE command to each pgbouncer server in the pgb_servers list (in parallel to all servers).
# 3. If all pgbouncer are successfully paused, the script exits.
# 4. If active queries do not complete within 30 seconds, the script forcibly terminates slow active queries using pg_slow_active_terminate_query.
# 5. If after that it is still not possible to pause the pgbouncer servers within 60 seconds from the start of the script, the script exits with an error.
#
# The script uses the 'pause_results' array to track the results of executing the PAUSE command on each pgbouncer server.
# The 'timeout 2' command is used to set a timeout for the execution of the 'pgb_pause_command'.
# If the execution of the 'pgb_pause_command' does not finish within 2 seconds,
# the timeout command will interrupt the execution of 'pgb_resume_command' and execute the pgb_resume_query command to remove the pause and ensure atomicity.
#
# Finally, the script checks whether all servers have been successfully paused by comparing the number of successful PAUSE executions to the total number of pgbouncer servers.
